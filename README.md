# UniFi Video

Adds support for Ubiquiti UniFi Video devices in Homey.

## Supported devices
* UniFi® NVR (Network Video Recorder):
	* UVC‑NVR
* UniFi® Video Camera G3 series:
	* UVC-G3
	* UVC-G3-AF
	* UVC-G3-DOME
	* UVC-G3-PRO
* UniFi® Video Camera G4 series:
	* UVC-G4-PRO

## Getting started
1. Create a user in the UniFi Video web interface that belongs to a group that has permissions `view camera` and `edit camera`.
2. Enable API access for this user and note/copy the API key.
3. Install this UniFi Video app on your Homey.
4. Start the 'add device wizard' in Homey, search for your connected UniFi camera(s), optionally name them and add them to your devices. You will be prompted to enter/paste the API key.
5. If the API key has changed in the UniFi Video web interface, it can be updated in the Homey app on the UniFi Video app's Settings page.

## Usage
* A flow action card can be used to create a snapshot, which is is saved to an Image tag.
* A flow can be triggered when a snapshot is created using the UniFi Video trigger card. This card supplies the name of the camera that created the snapshot and the snapshot image itself.
* A flow action card is available to set a camera's recording mode, being one of 'Don't record', 'Always record' or 'Record only motion'.

## Troubleshooting
* I can't seem to create a snapshot:
	* Make sure the UniFi Video user is part of a group that has the `view camera` permission.
* I can't seem to change the recording mode on a camera:
	* Make sure the UniFi Video user is part of a group that has the `edit camera` permission.
